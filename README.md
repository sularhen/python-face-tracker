# python-face-recognition
Face recognition for images or videos using python and opencv libraries. the principal objetive with this code
was to track faces in videos and save it as images when the target is the correct. I did it using python, Open
CV libraries (haar classifiers) and ArcFace model for embeeding. you can use it for tracking faces in images too.

HOW TO USE IT:

 - Copy and paste the code in your favorite code editor.
 - Save to code in a folder of your preference.
 - Change the route of your video or image in the code.
 - Run te code.
 - A folder is going to be created automatically with the faces saved in it.
